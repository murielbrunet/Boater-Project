    	<div class="col-xs-10" id="boaterHatDescription">
    		<p>During the 1890s, there was a promotion of of Victorian masculinity in women’s activities and appearance. This was largely due to the Muscular Christianity movement which was founded in this period on the idea that a proper Christian must be both spiritually and physically fit.  
  			<br>Women were now allowed and even encouraged to do masculine things such as play a game of tennis, go sailing, and participate in a new sport called basketball. For these physical activities women needed new attire, and so they adapted it from men’s wear, sometimes by taking a piece of men’s clothing and simply putting it on.
  			<br>One such piece was the boater hat--a hat that had become popular as semiformal sportswear for men. Initially, the women’s boater hat was identical to the men’s, but this changed rapidly. First, the hats became smaller to fit women’s hair better. Soon there were boater hats for all occasions and classes--fancy ones for a upperclass lady to wear around town, simpler ones with a nice grosgrain ribbon for a stroll on the beach, or mannish, plain ones for the working woman.
        <br>Displayed above is a 3D model of a boater hat circa 1890 from the Smith College Historic Dress Archives that is also displayed in the vitrine behind you.

                  <p>Since the time of its creation, the boater hat's classic design has been toyed with, as made evident by the wavy brim of this boater. Notice the use of faux blackberries as trimmings.<br>-<br>

                  <p>Due to its easy pace, croquet was considered a perfectly suitable sport for ladies. The attire for these ladies is only subtly different than that of regular day wear. Here the light straw hats seem to suggest a sense of leisure rather than sportiness.<br>-<br>

                  <p>These ladies exemplify the look of their era, with their shirtwaists, flared skirts and boater hats, but while they all are wearing the same type of clothing each one wears them slightly differently. The trimmings of the hats and the way they are worn give off so much of their individual personalities.<br>-<br>

                  <p>When lawn tennis first became a thing it was quite leisurely and slow compared to today's tennis matches. This meant that not only was it a sport allowed to be played amongst women, but that one could also keep a hat on while playing. What better hat could there be than a simple straw boater?<br>-<br>
