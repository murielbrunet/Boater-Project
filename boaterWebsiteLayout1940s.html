      <div class="col-xs-10" id="boaterHatDescription">
        <p>World War II had resounding impacts on women’s clothes and accessories. As a response to both the need for practicality and the new occupations now available to women, women’s clothing overall became more masculine. Flat shoes and pants were more commonplace, large pockets were used instead of purses, and everything started to look a little more like men’s uniforms.  
        <br>
        Materials and goods were rationed, making wardrobes smaller. Women put their limited funds into makeup and accessories such as hats and shoes, which could easily change the appearance of the whole outfit. The materials used for hats were inventive: raffia or cellophane instead of straw, and crumpled paper for decoration.  
        <br>
        Boater hats of the 1940s exemplify both of these trends as they are men’s formal sportswear adapted for women, and were often decorated with the latest millinery trends.
        <br>
        Displayed above is a 3D model of a boater hat circa 1945 from the Smith College Historic Dress Archives that is also displayed in the vitrine behind you. </p>

                <h3>Boater with Cover</h3>
                  <p>A fancy scarf tied around the chin is a surefire way to he keep your hat clean and on your head. This idea seems to have originated around turn of the turn of the century to prevent hats from flying off the heads of motorists, and was brought back in the 1940s presumably to protect one's hat during an air raid. <br>-<br>

                  <p>With a high crown and narrow brim, this boater looks like an updated version of the typical style for a 1910s boater. However, one should notice the difference in wearing style--situated on top of the head and tilted forward instead of being pulled snugly down around the head.<br>-<br>

                  <p>Elsa Schiaparelli, a highly influential surrealist fashion designer of the 1940s, designed this boater in 1937. It ties into two of Schiaparelli's inspirations, the theme of metamorphoses (represented by the butterflies) and the fashion of the 1890s (represented by the boater).<br>-<br>

                  <p>During WWII many designers believed that dress should include "beautiful styles that flatter, colours that charm, and details that amuse" (unknown source cited by Julian Robinson). To lift people's spirits during the harsh times of WWII women often decorated their clothes and hats with a little bit of whimsy. Notice the amusing use of carrots to decorate this boater.<br>-<br>

                  <p>This boater is typical of the 1940s, with a smaller, shallow crown and fetching veil. The model shows how it is meant to be tipped at a rakish angle. With a little bit of style, even a boater could be formal enough for Easter wear.<br>-<br>

                  <p>Only when in drag would you see a fashionable man wearing a boater in the 1940s. By the late 1930s boaters had fallen out of men's fashion, which was partially due to the fact that Prince Edward of Wales was not very fond of them. Many men followed suit in his use of the panama hat and soft-cap for sportswear instead. <br>-<br>
