			<p>When World War I, or the Great War, as it was known at the time, started in 1914, no one really thought it was going to last very long, so people and wardrobes were slow to adapt.
			<br>
			After the war had gained momentum, women’s dress took on a simpler look, losing a lot of its trimmings and flair. Khaki, the color of the troops’ uniforms, became popular. If women did don on uniforms--or worse, trousers--for practical purposes, they were often mocked for losing touch with their femininity. 
			<br>
			Despite this, clothing overall did become less restrictive, loose fitting tunics ideal for mass production came into fashion, corsets were ditched in favor of the brassiere, and a sporty look for both leisure and practical purposes came into play. 
			<br>
			The boater, of course, made its place amongst all of society, whether is was worn for a jaunty look by Coco Chanel, or for the high seas by a Canadian or English sailor.
      <br>
      Displayed above is a 3D model of a boater hat circa 1917-1920 from the Smith College Historic Dress Archives that is also displayed in the vitrine behind you. </p>

"The Campus Cat" was a Smith College publication that was created in 1918 to poke light fun at the college and share a little gossip. It was discontinued in the 1930s, and was later revived shortly after WWII ended.<br>-<br>

One such unit worked on the Hilltop Farm in Chesterfield, MA, ran by Smith librarian, Miss Josephine Clark. The "farmerettes," as they were affectionately called, in this photo have donned on midi blouses, skirts, ties, and sennet hats similar to those worn by the navy. <br>-<br>
